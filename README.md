# Design_Patterns

Abstract Factory: Creational Design Pattern
Let's you produce familier of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Adapter: Structural design pattern 
Allow objects with incmpatible interfaces to collaborate. 

Builder:  Creational Design Pattern
Let's you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and represantions of an object using the same construction code. 

Factory: Creational Design Pattern
Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. 

Observer : Behavioral Design Pattern 
Let's you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they're observing. The subscription list is dynamic, so subscribers can join or leave the list whenever they need to.

Singleton: Creational Design Pattern
Esnures that a class has only one instance while providing a global access point to this instance.

Composite: Structural design pattern
Lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

Prototype: Creational design pattern 
Let's you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

Strategy: Behavioral design pattern
Let's you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
